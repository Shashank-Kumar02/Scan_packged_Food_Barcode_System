# Scan_packged_Food_Barcode_System
**Scan Barcode Feature**
The Scan Barcode Feature enables users to scan barcodes from product images and retrieve detailed information, including product names, ingredients, and a health evaluation. Built using Python in Google Colab, this feature leverages the pyzbar library for barcode decoding and the Open Food Facts API to fetch product data. It also includes a health assessment that checks ingredients against predefined criteria for unhealthy additives, allergens, and beneficial nutrients, providing users with insights into the product's health impact.

**Key Features:**
Upload and decode barcodes from images using pyzbar and OpenCV.
Fetch product details and ingredients via the Open Food Facts API.
Evaluate ingredient health impact based on user-defined criteria (e.g., allergens, unhealthy additives).
Display results with product name, ingredients, and health evaluation.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, OpenCV, pyzbar, pillow, requests
Google Colab for image upload and processing
